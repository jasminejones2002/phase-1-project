# My Personal Library

## Description
My Personal Library is an application designed to help users keep track of the books they read and when the user read them. It allows the user to input the book's title, author, and allows you to selct the genre from a dropdown menu. Finally, the user is able to select the date that you finished reading the book to keep track of the date. Then the application will add the book to the list of books that have already been added. The user then has the option to delete a book they have added if they feel the need to do so.
